RenameExt - Rename Extensions
==============

I wrote this project to solve a problem I had with Windows a few years ago. I wanted to hide the files' extensions, but to have the ability to easily rename them.
This project creates a DLL; once registered, it gives another option on the context menu when right clicking a file:

Pressing this option gives a small dialog that helps us easily rename the extension:
